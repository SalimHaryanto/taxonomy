      Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo (born 17 October 1951) is an Indonesian
      politician, businessman, and former military officer who has served as the
      eighth president of Indonesia since 2024. He was previously the 26th
      minister of defense under President Joko Widodo from 2019 to 2024. Prabowo
      is Indonesia's third president to have a military background after Suharto
      and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and is the oldest first-term president in
      Indonesian history.

      Prabowo graduated from the Indonesian Military Academy (Akademi Militer
      Nasional) in 1970 and primarily served in the Special Forces (Kopassus)
      until he was appointed to lead the Strategic Reserves Command (Kostrad) in
      1998. Later that same year, he was discharged from the military and
      subsequently banned from entering the United States for allegedly
      committing human rights abuses.

      In early 2008, Prabowo's inner circle established the Gerindra Party. In
      the 2009 presidential election, he ran unsuccessfully for the vice
      presidency as Megawati Sukarnoputri's running mate. He contested the 2014
      presidential election and was defeated by Jakarta governor Joko Widodo,
      which he initially disputed. He made another unsuccessful run for the
      presidency in 2019 against Joko Widodo, with Sandiaga Uno as his running
      mate and with the support of Gerindra, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS),
      the National Mandate Party (PAN), the Democratic Party (Demokrat), and
      Berkarya Party. His refusal to accept the result saw his followers stage
      protests that sparked riots in Jakarta. However, after a heated contest,
      Prabowo joined Joko Widodo's cabinet as his minister of defense for the
      2019 to 2024 period.

      On 10 October 2021, Gerindra announced Prabowo as their candidate in the
      2024 Indonesian presidential election. On 12 August 2022, Prabowo
      announced that he accepted Gerindra's nomination. Prabowo declared victory
      in the election on 14 February 2024, as early unofficial polling showed
      him with a lead in the first round of voting. On 20 March, the General
      Election Commission (KPU) certified the results and declared him as the
      president-elect of Indonesia. The Constitutional Court (MK) confirmed his
      status on 22 April 2024. Prabowo was sworn in as the 8th president of
      Indonesia on 20 October 2024.

      ## Early life and family

      Prabowo's father, Sumitro Djojohadikusumo (1917–2001), was originally from
      Gombong, Kebumen. He was an economist who served as former President
      Sukarno's minister for the economy and Suharto's minister for research and
      technology. Sumitro named Prabowo after his own younger brother who was
      killed in an incident against Japanese forces in Lengkong, Tangerang
      during the Indonesian National Revolution. Prabowo's mother, Dora Marie
      Sigar (1919–2008), was a Protestant Christian of Minahasan and German
      descent, who originated from the Sigar-Maengkom family in Langowan, North
      Sulawesi. Her father was a member of the Volksraad of the Dutch East
      Indies. They were married in Matraman, East Jakarta.

  - context: >-
      Prabowo's brother, Hashim, is one of the wealthiest businessmen in
      Indonesia with assets across the globe from Indonesia to Europe and North
      America. Due to his father's political exile borne from differences with
      Sukarno in the 1960s, they lived in self-exile, notably in countries such
      as Switzerland, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom.
      Henceforth, Prabowo and his siblings have a cosmopolitan background.
      During his high school years, he studied at Victoria Institution in Kuala
      Lumpur, Malaysia. Between 1966 and 1968, the family lived in London, where
      Prabowo attended and graduated from the American School. Sumitro
      subsequently encouraged his son to attend a military academy. According to
      peers and observers, Prabowo was talented with a passion for stratagems
      and had an appetite for political power.

      Sumitro himself came from an elite background. His father, Margono
      Djojohadikusumo, was the founder of the country's first state bank Bank
      Negara Indonesia (BNI), the first leader of Indonesia's provisional
      Supreme Advisory Council (DPA), and a member of the Investigating
      Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK) that drafted the
      steps for Indonesia's independence. With the pedigrees of his father and
      grandfather, Prabowo is the third generation of a family that has served
      high positions in Indonesia since its establishment in 1945.

      Prabowo and Titiek have a son, Didit Hediprasetyo, who lived in Boston
      before settling in Paris to pursue a career in fashion design. While his
      son has shown little interest in politics, Prabowo is uncle to Gerindra
      politicians Thomas Djiwandono, Budi Djiwandono, Aryo Djojohadikusumo, and
      Rahayu Djojohadikusumo, who will together continue the Djojohadikusumo
      political lineage.

          nephews—Thomas, Budi, Aryo, and Rahayu—are active Gerindra politicians
          continuing the family’s political influence.
  - context: >-
      Prabowo enrolled in the Indonesian Military Academy (Akademi Militer
      Nasional) in Magelang in 1970. He graduated in 1974 with others who would
      gain senior leadership positions, such as Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.

      In 1976, Prabowo served in the Indonesian Army Special Forces Command
      (Kopassus) and was assigned as the commander of Group 1 Komando Pasukan
      Sandhi Yudha (Kopassandha), which was one of the Indonesian Army's
      Nanggala commando units in East Timor, the former Portuguese territory
      that Indonesia had invaded the previous year. Prabowo, then 26 years old,
      was the youngest Nanggala commander. Prabowo led the mission to capture
      the vice president of Fretilin, who was the first prime minister of East
      Timor, Nicolau dos Reis Lobato. Guiding Prabowo was Antonio Lobato –
      Nicolau's younger brother. On 31 December 1978, Prabowo's company found
      and fatally shot Nicolau in the stomach as he was being escorted in
      Maubisse, fifty kilometres south of Dili.

      In 1981, Captain Inf. Prabowo with Major Inf. Luhut Binsar Panjaitan was
      sent by the TNI to attend Anti-terror Training in GSG-9 Germany, and after
      graduate from the course, TNI forming the first anti-terror unit in
      Indonesia, the Detasemen 81 Anti Teror under the Kopassus. With Luhut as
      the detachment commander and Prabowo as the vice-commander.

      In 1983, it was claimed that Prabowo commanded the special forces
      responsible for the Kraras massacres in East Timor. The survivors of these
      massacres were locked up in a concentration camp guarded by Prabowo's men,
      where many died of starvation and ill-treatment. Prabowo claimed he was
      nowhere near the Viqueque district when the massacre happened, and neither
      the UN nor the government of Timor Leste have ever proffered charges of
      human rights violations against him. Jose Manuel Tesoro, writing for
      Asiaweek in 2000, contacted four separate non-governmental organizations
      including TAPOL in London; Solidamor in Jakarta; the HAK Foundation,
      headquartered in Dili; and the East Timor Action Network (ETAN) in New
      York, and they could not provide any eyewitness reports, transcripts of
      intercepted communications, leaked papers, or anything that could
      substantiate Prabowo's involvement.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: When did Prabowo begin his military career?
        answer: >-
          He enrolled in the Indonesian Military Academy in 1970, graduated in
          1974, and rose alongside future leaders such as Susilo Bambang
          Yudhoyono.
      - question: What role did Prabowo play in East Timor?
        answer: >-
          As the youngest Nanggala commander, he led operations targeting
          Fretilin leaders and oversaw the mission that resulted in Nicolau
          Lobato’s death in 1978.
      - question: What controversies arose from his East Timor service?
        answer: >-
          He was accused of involvement in the 1983 Kraras massacres, though he
          denied it, and multiple NGOs found no direct evidence linking him to
          the abuses.
  - context: >-
      Less than three months after his appointment as head of Kostrad, on the
      first day of the May 1998 riots, Prabowo urged the commander of the
      Indonesian National Armed Forces (ABRI), General Wiranto, to let him bring
      his Strategic Reserve units from outside Jakarta into the city to help
      restore order. Hundreds of men trained by Kopassus (Prabowo's former
      command) were flown from Dili to Yogyakarta in chartered planes, and then
      on to Jakarta by train. Prabowo publicly urged Indonesians to join him to
      fight "traitors to the nation". On the morning of 14 May, Kopassus troops
      escorted young thugs from Lampung in southern Sumatra into the capital.
      Thus Prabowo was accused of using his contacts in his former command to
      import and create trouble, while Wiranto had declined to give Prabowo's
      current command, Kostrad, permission to quell the existing trouble, in
      line with classic Javanese tactic to stir chaos to discredit a rival
      and/or seize power.

      Troops under Prabowo's command kidnapped and tortured at least nine
      democracy activists in the months before the May 1998 riots. In one
      testimony from Andi Arief, a former detainee told of being tortured for
      days in an unidentified location, allegedly a military camp where most of
      their time was spent blindfolded, while being forced to answer repeated
      questions, mainly concerning their political activities. The abuse
      included being punched, terrorised physically and mentally, and given
      electric shocks. Later, in 2009, two of the nine men were candidates for
      Gerindra, Prabowo's political party, and another served as his media
      adviser. By 2024, six out of the nine kidnapped (including Arief) have
      either worked for Prabowo, or backed him for the presidency. Prabowo was
      also suspected of organising the kidnappings of another 13 activists (all
      of whom remain "missing") between February 1997 and May 1998.

      Later investigations into the May riots revealed that violence in Jakarta
      was the result of an internal struggle within the military elite to become
      Suharto's successor. Many believed Prabowo, as Army Strategic Reserve
      Command (Kostrad) commander, sought to become his father-in-law's
      successor and coveted the commander of the Armed Forces position held by
      General Wiranto, who was favoured to succeed Suharto. Together with
      Operations Commander for Greater Jakarta (Panglima Komando Operasi Jakarta
      Raya, Pangkoops Jaya) Major General Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, Prabowo aimed to
      terrorise opponents of the government and to show that Wiranto was "an
      incompetent commander who could not control disorder". During August and
      September, the fact-finding team interviewed Prabowo, Sjafrie, and other
      military commanders regarding their movements during the Jakarta riots.
      Prabowo asserted that he was unsure of the precise movements of military
      forces in the capital and deferred to Sjafrie. In its final report, the
      fact-finding team suspected that, on the night of 14 May, Prabowo met with
      several Armed Forces and prominent civilian figures at the Kostrad
      headquarters to discuss organization of the violence. However, this was
      later refuted by several people who attended the meeting, including
      prominent human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution and Joint Fact-Finding
      Team member, Bambang Widjojanto. Further testimonies by Prabowo in the
      years following the investigation contradicted the team's report and led
      to scepticism of the team's allegations.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How was Prabowo involved during the May 1998 riots?
        answer: >-
          He pushed to deploy Kostrad troops into Jakarta, while Kopassus-linked
          forces and hired thugs were brought in. Critics accused him of
          exploiting chaos to undermine General Wiranto and position himself as
          Suharto’s successor.
      - question: What were the activist-kidnapping allegations against Prabowo?
        answer: >-
          Troops under his command abducted at least nine democracy activists
          and allegedly tortured them. Thirteen others disappeared. Some later
          worked for or supported Prabowo, adding complexity but not erasing the
          original accusations.
      - question: What did investigations conclude about Prabowo’s role in the unrest?
        answer: >-
          Fact-finding teams suspected he helped orchestrate violence to weaken
          rivals, though some witnesses later challenged these claims.
          Conflicting testimonies left the allegations unresolved and
          politically charged.
